##Description:
This assignment will have you create a simple Javascript object that will be exported using the NodeJS modular pattern we went over in class.

Your object should have a function named 'greet' that takes a name as a parameter and returns the string 'hello ' + name.  

You should have at least one test that verifies the output of the function.  

Your code should pass the **.eslintrc** included in this repository.  

Your submission should be a link to your pull request.  

##Bonus:
For an extra point, create a command line utility that will be run using node greet.js 'some name' and will pass the input contained in that argument to the greet function and output the result to the screen.
